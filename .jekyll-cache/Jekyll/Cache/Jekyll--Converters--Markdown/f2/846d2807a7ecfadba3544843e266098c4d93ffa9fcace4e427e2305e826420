I"‚<p>This is the first blog post of this site.</p>

<p>I think it will not be a really busy one but, hey, I wanted to try to host a statically generated website on github with github actions Â¯(ãƒ„)/Â¯
And since Iâ€™m missing a place to just push some content when I need it was time to start it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the peoples behind repo for the theme as my design skills are awfull</p>
